## 🗺️ Product Roadmap

### Milestone 1: Expected Yield Matching & Location-Agnostic Profiling (ACTIVE)
*Provide flexibility for investors who prioritize yields over location coordinates.*
- [ ] **Database Expansion**: Add `min_roi` NUMERIC field to `contacts`.
- [ ] **UI Preferences**: Create expected min ROI number controls in Contact Forms and Preference Drawers.
- [ ] **Matching Logic**: Filter properties so `property.roi >= contact.min_roi`.
- [ ] **Location Agnosticism**: Allow contacts with empty areas or areas containing `'any'` to match properties in any sublocality.
- [ ] **Scoring Adjustments**: Weight the ROI yield component in matching scoring calculations.

### Milestone 2: Interactive Webhook Webflows & Automated Template Management (Q3 2026)
*Reduce chat friction by migrating text conversations into structured WhatsApp buttons and selection flows.*
- [ ] **Meta Template Sync**: Auto-fetch approved templates from Meta Graph API to sync text layouts, headers, and media options.
- [ ] **Interactive Buttons**: Replace textual confirmation steps in chatbot flows with Meta Cloud API Interactive Reply Buttons.
- [ ] **WhatsApp Interactive Flows**: Allow buyers to fill/update their budget and locality preferences directly inside WhatsApp using form screen flows.
- [ ] **Outbound Broadcast Queue**: Implement dynamic retries with exponential backoffs for throttled or failed Meta Graph API outbound requests.

### Milestone 3: AI PDF Brochures & Customer Analytics (Q4 2026)
*Empower agents to generate high-quality marketing collateral on the fly and track customer engagement.*
- [ ] **AI Flyer Customization**: Support custom layout templates for AI-generated flyers (including typography, branding, and color palettes).
- [ ] **Brochure Compiler**: Generate downloadable PDF property brochures containing highlights, specs, maps, and agent details.

### Milestone 4: RERA Registry Integration & Real Estate Portal Sync (Q1 2027)

### Milestone 5: Visual Pipelines & Financial Forecasting (Q2 2027)
*Turn matches into closed deals with a visual sales pipeline, commission management, and dashboard reporting.*
- [ ] **Visual Kanban Deals Board**: Drag and drop deals across pipeline stages (`Lead`, `Site Visit`, `Negotiation`, `Closed`).
- [ ] **Brokerage & Commission Splits**: Track expected brokerage commissions, agent splits, and referrer payout splits.
- [ ] **Analytics Dashboard**: Graph monthly closed deal values, conversion rates per agent, and top-yielding marketing templates.
