## Key features in detail

### Property showcase

A branded public portal at the root URL (`/`) with:
- Category filters (Residential, Commercial, Land), bedroom/price/sort controls
- Property detail modal with image gallery, specs, map, nearby highlights
- WhatsApp click-to-chat inquiries with auto-generated messages
- Interest tracking (thumbs up/down) with localStorage persistence
- **Agent mode** (`?mode=agent`): hides inquiry forms and interest buttons for co-broker sharing
- Meta Pixel tracking (ViewContent, Search, Lead, Contact, ShareProperty)
- Configurable branding via showcase settings (logo, colors, currency, subdomain)

### Email lead sync (MagicBricks, Housing.com, 99acres)

Incoming portal emails are parsed by portal-specific extractors that:
- Extract name, phone, email, requirement
- Match property details against published inventory (scored matching)
- Auto-create contacts with source tracking and automatic tagging
- Send WhatsApp auto-replies using approved templates (24h window-aware)
- Log all actions to email sync audit log

### WhatsApp update sessions

Contacts can update CRM data directly from WhatsApp:
- "update property PROP-1018" → guided field-by-field property editing
- "update contact" → guided field-by-field contact editing
- Supports "cancel" to abort, "all" for full wizard, field-specific commands
- One active session per contact enforced

### Go webhook ingress

A standalone Go service that sits in front of the Node.js application:
- Verifies HMAC-SHA256 signatures with constant-time comparison
- Enqueues verified payloads to Redis and returns HTTP 200 instantly
- Proxies verification challenges to Next.js for DB-backed token matching
- Dockerized multi-stage build (7MB final image)
