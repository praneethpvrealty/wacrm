## Phase 1 — Create a Meta Business Portfolio (Business Manager)

Before starting, the user must have a Meta Business Portfolio.

1. Go to [business.facebook.com/overview](https://business.facebook.com/overview).
2. Click **Create Account**.
3. Enter the Business Name, User Name, and Business Email, and click **Submit**.
4. Verify the email address in the verification email sent by Meta.

## Phase 2 — Create a Meta Developer App

This app acts as the API bridge between the CRM database and Meta's servers.

1. Go to the [Meta for Developers Portal](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).
2. Click **Create App** (top right).
3. **Select Use Case:** Select **"Other"** or **"Connect with customers through WhatsApp"**.
   > [!TIP]
   > Selecting the WhatsApp use case pre-configures the app, saving manual configuration steps.
4. Select your **Meta Business Portfolio** in the dropdown to link ownership.
5. Give the app a name (e.g. `[My Business] CRM`) and click **Create App**.

## Phase 3 — Set Up the WhatsApp Business Account & Number

## Phase 4 — Generate a Permanent Access Token (System User)

By default, developer console tokens expire in 24 hours. Production CRMs require a permanent **System User Token**.

1. Go to [Meta Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings).
2. Go to **Users** → **System Users** (left sidebar).
3. Click **Add** to create a new system user. Select **Admin System User** as the role.

   - **WhatsApp Accounts:** Select your account and toggle **Full Control** (Manage WhatsApp Account) to **On**.
   - Click **Save Changes**.
5. **Generate Token:**
   - Click **Generate New Token**.
   - Select your CRM App from the dropdown.
   - Select **Never** for token expiration.
   - Check the following scopes:
     - `whatsapp_business_messaging` ✅
     - `whatsapp_business_management` ✅
     - `catalog_management` ✅ *(Note: If this scope is missing, see Phase 6 below first)*.
   - Click **Generate Token** and copy the token. **Save it securely.**

5. Choose your Business Portfolio owner, name the catalog (e.g., `Aryavarta Properties`), and click **Create**.
6. Go to **Settings** (gear icon) and copy the **Catalog ID** (e.g., `1547752690053122`).

### Step 2: Assign System User Access to the Catalog
1. Go to [Meta Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings) → **Data Sources** → **Catalogs**.
